Done:
[x] add codeacademy badges?
[x] add codewars badges?
[x] add scholarship news article (they didnt upload your name in the article :) so make a little award poster about being an awardee)
[x] migrate to Heroku? Redirect charliehowlett.com dns? (actually changed to netify cdn hosting)
[x] give list items chevron rotation animation on click
[x] figure out why on firefox, previous work icons are not centered properly. I imagine this is because of the hacky 1px method used to center them on other browsers. update to use flexbox properly.
[x] display title page with css grid for positioning chevron and title easier
[x] add link to personal curated spotify playlist for coding backing music
[x] move to scss and refactor to external style files
[x] parallax cloud speeds
[x] make mobile version take up full width
[x] begin painting clouds offscreen which then float into view (render few at first for performance)
[x] make cloud speed relative to browser width (add timer for speed control?)
[x] Redesign color scheme
[x] add dark theme button (probably only really viable with css variables)
[x] add scss variables for margin/padding sizes (small, medium, large etc)

In progress:
[] Redesign website for minamilism
[] refactor code for cleanliness
[] instead of More/Less buttons, make sections titles the buttons
[] REMOVE SCOPED DIRECTIVES FOR PERFORMANCE
[] compress images for faster loading

Todo:
[] update work done and CV !!!
[] make title page text chunkier and bigger for impact. Perhaps also use a nice looking font
[] browser compatibility
[] remove unnecessary javascript libraries for faster performance
[] add clouds and sun as vector images instead of drawing them using p5
[] LAZY LOADING
[] remove jQuery and other javascript libraries for faster loading
[] GENERATE 3 RANDOM TIMES AT STARTUP TO DETERMINE CREATE TIME OF NEW CLOUDS (no longer need to generate n_clouds*random_numbers) 
[] Fix bug where clouds dont render if you leave the tab open but unfocused for a significant period of time

Maybe:
[] add last tracking of last project that I worked on (using github api to find last accessed repo)?
[] live updates of codewars badges through scraping?
[] add loading screen for site startup?
[] add buttons for options in cloud generation
[] cloud flyweight pattern
